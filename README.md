lm-stack aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use overview of popular large language models.

## Adding a new model

To add a new model, you need to create a new model .json file in the `data/llm` directory. These get bundled into the app at build time. Logos for a new provider need to be available in the `public/logos` directory as a .svg file.
